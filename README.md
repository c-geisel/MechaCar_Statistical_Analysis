# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose
In this analysis the data is being explored for the optimal prototypes for the new MechaCar. However, there are production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing teamâ€™s progress and thus production data is being reviewed to assist the manufacturing team. Using R, different statistical tests are run to analyze the performance of various variables. A statistical study is also performed in order to improve vehicle performance.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
MechaCar prototypes are created with many different design specifications in order to identify ideal vehicle performance specifications. a linear regression model is produced in order to the mpg of the MechaCar based on different variables. Below, a linear regression is completed with 6 variables passed in:

The summary function is then used on the previous function in order to identify the p-value and r^2 for the linear regression model.

- In the second image, the Pr(>|t|) value for each variable is shown. A very small value has a statistically singificant relationship with the response variable in the model and a larger value does not have a significant relationship. With this being said, the Intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance can be said to provide a non-random amout of variance to the mpg values in the dataset due to their size.  
- The null hypothesis for a linear regression is that the slope of the model is zero. The alternate hypothesis is that the slope is not zero. Given our significance level of 0.5, our p-value lies much lower than this and we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. 
- Using the r squared value, future observations can be predicted as this value represents how well the model approximates real world points. There are two values listed, the multiple r squared and the adjusted r squared values. Multiple r squared values increase as more variables are added since more variables explains some variance. The adjusted r squared values acts a control for the increase of the multiple r suqared value and lowers it for the number of factors included in our regression model. With this being said we will use the adjusted r squared value of 0.6825. This value tells us that 68.25% of variability of the dependent variable is explained by our model and thus does predict the mpg of prototypes effectively.
