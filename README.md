# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose
In this analysis the data is being explored for the optimal prototypes for the new MechaCar. However, there are production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing teamâ€™s progress and thus production data is being reviewed to assist the manufacturing team. Using R, different statistical tests are run to analyze the performance of various variables. A statistical study is also performed in order to improve vehicle performance.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
MechaCar prototypes are created with many different design specifications in order to identify ideal vehicle performance specifications. a linear regression model is produced in order to the mpg of the MechaCar based on different variables. Below, a linear regression is completed with 6 variables passed in:

The summary function is then used on the previous function in order to identify the p-value and r^2 for the linear regression model.

- In the second image, the Pr(>|t|) value for each variable is shown. A very small value has a statistically singificant relationship with the response variable in the model and a larger value does not have a significant relationship. With this being said, the Intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance can be said to provide a non-random amout of variance to the mpg values in the dataset due to their size.  
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The null hypothesis for a linear regression is that the slope of the model is zero. The alternate hypothesis is that the slope is not zero. Given that our significant level is at 0.5, our p-value lies much lower than this and we reject the null hypothesis. There fore the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. 
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? (DO NOT INCLUDE THIS "Multiple R-squared increases as more variables are passed through the regression. However, adjusted R-squared controls against this increase, and adds penalties for the number of predictors in the model, thus making it a more accurate predictor of how effective the linear model is.")
